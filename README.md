# QSOL v1.0

> **"Small Is Beautiful. Fast is Holy."**

## Philosophy

QSOL (Quick & Simple Open-source Library) is a modern open-source framework inspired by [tinyapps.org](https://tinyapps.org), dedicated to creating ultra-efficient, minimal, local-first tools that prioritize clarity over complexity.

We believe that software has become unnecessarily bloated. QSOL is a return to the fundamentals:
- **Small is Beautiful** - Every line of code must justify its existence
- **Fast is Holy** - Performance is not a feature, it's a requirement
- **Local-First** - Privacy and independence through local execution
- **Clarity over Complexity** - Simple solutions that anyone can understand and modify

## Core Principles

### 1. **Size Constraints**
- Each module must be comprehensible in a single sitting
- Source code should be measurable in kilobytes, not megabytes
- Dependencies are a liability, not an asset - use sparingly

### 2. **Speed Constraints**
- Build times measured in seconds, not minutes
- Runtime performance that feels instant
- No bloat, no unnecessary abstractions

### 3. **Transparency Constraints**
- Code should be readable by intermediate programmers
- No magic - explicit over implicit
- Documentation is mandatory, obfuscation is forbidden

## What QSOL Provides

QSOL is a collection of:
- **Minimal Modules** - Small, focused tools that do one thing well
- **Zero-Bloat Design** - No frameworks, minimal dependencies
- **Local-First Architecture** - Run everything on your machine
- **Fast Build Times** - Complete builds in seconds
- **Clear Documentation** - Every module is self-explanatory

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/QSOLKCB/QSOL.git
cd QSOL

# Explore available modules
ls modules/

# Each module is self-contained and includes:
# - Source code (simple and readable)
# - Build script (if needed)
# - README with usage examples
# - Tests (optional but encouraged)
```

## Repository Structure

```

## Sacred Constraints

Every QSOL module must adhere to:

1. **Build in seconds** - If it takes minutes, it's too complex
2. **Run without bloat** - Minimal memory, minimal dependencies
3. **Honor clarity** - Code as documentation
4. **Stay local** - No unnecessary network calls
5. **Be transparent** - No hidden behavior

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that align with the QSOL philosophy. Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting.

Remember: **The best code is no code. The second best is simple code.**

## License

QSOL is open-source software. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Inspiration

QSOL draws inspiration from:
- [tinyapps.org](https://tinyapps.org) - Celebrating small, focused software
- The Unix Philosophy - Do one thing and do it well
- The Suckless movement - Simplicity and clarity
- Plan 9 - Clean, minimal design
