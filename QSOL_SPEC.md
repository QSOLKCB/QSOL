## 1 · Core Philosophy

Software is a living organism.  
The smaller it is, the faster it breathes.  
Bloat is not progress — it's entropy disguised as productivity.  

> "Every byte should earn its keep. Every wait should justify its existence.  
> Every dependency should kneel before necessity."

QSOL code is minimalist, legible, and *sacredly efficient.*  
Speed and simplicity are not afterthoughts — they are moral obligations.

## 2 · Design Principles

1. **Simplicity as Precision** — Complexity is laziness in disguise.  
2. **Fast is Holy** — No operation, build, or startup may exceed 1 s.  
3. **No Dependencies Without Purpose** — Every import must justify its weight.  
4. **Readable ≠ Verbose** — Clear over clever; concise over clunky.  
5. **Local First, Cloud Optional** — Offline by default.  
6. **Transparent by Design** — No opaque binaries or configs.  
7. **Memory is Sacred** — Reuse, recycle, reduce allocations.

## 3 · Structural Rules

- **File Size Cap:** 100 KB per module (max).  
- **Build Time:** ≤ 3 s from clean source on mid-range CPU.  
- **Startup Latency:** ≤ 1 s.  
- **Dependencies:** Zero by default; any external import must be justified in README.  
- **Code Ratio:** 80 % logic / 20 % scaffolding.  
- **Docs:** Only `README.md` and `PHILOSOPHY.md`. If the code can't explain itself, it isn't QSOL.

## 4 · Repository Layout

```text
QSOL/
├── core/              # Minimal engine modules
├── tools/             # Micro-utilities (<50 KB each)
├── samples/           # Example apps built on QSOL
├── tests/             # Lightweight test suite
├── README.md          # The soul
├── PHILOSOPHY.md      # The scripture
└── LICENSE
```

Every folder must justify its existence.

## 5 · Development Code of Honor

* If you need a framework — build one smaller.
* If you need a config — make it self-documenting.
* If it feels sluggish — it's already too big.
* If you can't explain a module in one sentence — delete it.

Commit messages should read like an engineer's haiku: direct, minimal, true.

## 6 · Performance Creed

Performance is a moral stance, not a benchmark.
To be fast is to respect the user's time, energy, and attention.
A fast program is humble — it loads quietly, works instantly, and disappears without complaint.

---

## 7 · Future Extensions

* **QSOL-TinyOS** — Micro-runtime for executing QSOL modules.
* **QSOL-Spec v2.0** — Introduce ternary logic compliance for quantum-inspired minimalism.
* **QSOL-Signal** — Zero-latency collaboration layer.
