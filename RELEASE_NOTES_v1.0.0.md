## üß¨ The Doctrine

QSOL is the anti-bloat micro-framework ‚Äî a return to code that breathes.

It borrows from [tinyapps.org](https://tinyapps.org), the hacker ethos of the '90s, and the MEMESTACKS philosophy.

No frameworks wrapped around frameworks. No 500 MB build trees. No lies about "simplicity."

Just lean, local-first tools that compile in seconds and *move like lightning*.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Additions

**Four working exemplars of the QSOL creed:**

* **Line Counter** ‚Äî 60 LOC (C/Python), pure stdlib.
* **Web Server** ‚Äî 122 LOC, 55 ms startup.
* **File Converter** ‚Äî 202 LOC, handles 10k rows/sec.
* **Task Runner** ‚Äî 150 LOC, no DSL, no config ‚Äî just functions.

Every file is under 100 KB. Every module builds in under 3 seconds.

Zero dependencies. Zero excuses.

## üìú Documentation

* **`MEMESTACKS_PHILOSOPHY.md`** ‚Äî Three sacred laws: *Small Is Beautiful, Fast Is Holy, Clarity Over Complexity.*
* **`QSOL_SPEC.md`** ‚Äî The doctrine itself: structure, creed, performance vows.
* **`CONSTRAINTS_VALIDATION.md`** ‚Äî Proof of compliance; all metrics pass.
* **`QUICKSTART.md`** ‚Äî Spin up a working tool in < 60 seconds.

Markdown? Tolerated only because it fits inside 100 KB.

## üîí Patch Note

Codex flagged a minor issue:

`--no-index` flag didn't suppress directory listing.

Fix incoming: override `list_directory()` to send 403 Forbidden.

QSOL doesn't serve what it doesn't mean to.

## üß† Next

* **QSOL-TinyOS:** micro-runtime for embedded execution.
* **QSOL-Signal:** zero-latency messaging layer.
* **FUZZ-2.0 Spec Integration:** audio-visual minimalism engine.
